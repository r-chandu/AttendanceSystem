# School Attendance System

This is a 10-part code-along project to build a console-based school attendance system in Java.

## Session 1: Introduction and Orientation

- Verified Java and Git setup.
- Initialized Git repository for the project.
- Created basic project structure with `Main.java`.
- Compiled and ran the initial "Welcome" program.
- Pushed initial setup to a `part-01` branch on GitHub and created a PR.

### How to Run

1. Navigate to the project root directory (`AttendanceSystem`)
2. Compile: `javac src/com/school/Main.java`
3. Run: `java -cp src com.school.Main`

## Session 2: Core Domain Modelling
- Defined `Student` class with `studentId`, `name`, `setDetails()`, and `displayDetails()` method.
- Defined `Course` class with `courseId`, `courseName`, `setDetails()`, and `displayDetails()` method.
- Utilized arrays of objects in `Main.java` to manage and display multiple students and courses.
- Introduced basic usage of `this` keyword.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the project root directory.
2. Compile: `javac src/com/school/*.java`
3. Run: `java -cp src com.school.Main`
